# Coursemology Theme
This is the official Coursemology branding, used in http://coursemology.org/.

## Contributing
Clone this repository into the `app/themes` directory of the Coursemology application, calling 
this `coursemology.localhost`. You need to have a `coursemology.localhost` instance defined in your
Coursemology install.

Modify your hosts file to resolve `coursemology.local` to your own machine (`127.0.0.1`), and 
connect to the running Coursemology server using http://coursemology.local. This theme should be
loaded in place of the default.
